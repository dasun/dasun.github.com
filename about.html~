		<p>I am Dasun, a student and a computer enthusiast.</p> 
		<p>I am interested in computer oriented stuff and love to learn and work with emerging technologies. Nowadays, I spend most of my time in researching web technologies, and I am really enjoying it. In addition to these things, I always love to experiment with electronics specially with <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> whenever I have a free time.</p>

		<p>In this website I hope to share my thoughts, experiences, codes and things I am excited about.</p>

		<p>Now you know a bit about me. Feel free to have a look at my website and don't hesitate to <a href="/contact.html">contact me</a> if you are really interested. </p>
			<p>Thanks for reading.
