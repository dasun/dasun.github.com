<h4>Hello! Welcome to my personal website.</h4>
<p>I am Dasun, a student and a computer enthusiast.</p> 
<p>I love to learn and work with emerging technologies since I was a child. Since then I have been working with many technologies like <span style="color:#08C;">java, .net, c++, python, jsp, php, Zend, JS, HTML5, CSS3, CMS, MySQL, SQL Server, Linux, networking and much more.</span> Nowadays, I spend most of my time in researching web technologies, and I am really enjoying it. In addition to these things, I always love to experiment with electronics specially with <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> whenever I have a free time.</p>

<p>Now you know a bit about me. Feel free to have a look at my website and don't hesitate to <a href="/contact.html">contact me</a> if you are really interested.
