		<p>I am Dasun, a student and a computer enthusiast.</p> 
		<p>I am interested in computer oriented stuff and love to learn and work with emerging technologies. Nowadays, I spend most of my time in researching web technologies, and I am really enjoying it. In addition to these things, I always love to experiment with electronics specially with <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> whenever I have a free time.</p>

		<p>In this website I hope to share my thoughts, experiences, codes and things I am excited about.</p>
